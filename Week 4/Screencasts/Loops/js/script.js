//While Loop

var b = 10;//setup the index

while (b > 0){//checks the condition
	console.log(b + "kegs on the wall");//concatnation, which allows the while loop to countdown.
	b--;//can incroment it by saying b++ but right not we are decromenting it. (increments or decrements the index)
}

//Do While Loop
//Gives same print out as the one above. This isn't as popularly used.
var c = 10;

do{//do as long as; this code in here will be ran before 
	console.log(c + "kegs on the wall");
	c--;
}
while(c > 0);//this condition is true; this condition can be decided as true or false.
